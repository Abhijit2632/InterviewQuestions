Spring Boot Annotations have certain advantages attached to them such as-
    - Boilerplate code is decreased
    - XML configuration is not required
    - POM dependency management

Ex,

    - @SpringBootApplication
    - @EnableAutoConfiguration
        - How to disable auto configuration
            @EnableAutoConfiguration(exclude = {ListOfClasses})
    
    - @Service          //For Service classes
    - @Repository       //For DAO classes that deals with DB directly
    - @Configuration    //class having one or more @Bean methods.
    - @Controller       //class is a web request handler.
    - @Component
    - @RestController
        - class level.
    - @Autowired        //used to auto-wire spring bean on setter methods, constructor and instance variable

    - @RequestMapping   //is used to map the HTTP request

    - @Bean
        - used at the method level
        - managed by the Spring container(Spring IoC container)
        - type of beans
        -
